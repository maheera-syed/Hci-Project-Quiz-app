# Quiz Application Readme

Welcome to the Quiz Application repository! This Android app is all about having fun while testing your knowledge with a set of true or false questions. Below, I'll take you on a tour of the app's exciting features, and I've also included a video demonstration for you to watch.

## Features to Enjoy üöÄ

### Dive into the Quiz
- My app brings you a variety of true or false quiz questions to challenge your knowledge.
- These questions are loaded from a dynamic question bank containing 20 unique questions loaded from the string resource along with a randomized background color.
- What's cool? The questions are easily customizable and even support multiple languages for a global audience.

### Instant Feedback
- Wondering if your answers are right on the mark? My app has you covered.
#### Feedback Toast
- After answering a question, the app displays a toast message to provide feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

### Don't Lose Progress
- No need to worry about losing your quiz progress when you rotate your device.
- I've implemented state-saving, so your current question and score are preserved even when you switch between portrait and landscape modes.

### Know Your Score
- Keep track of your quiz success with a clear and concise score display.
- See your score as "X over 20," where 20 represents the total number of questions in the quiz.

### Helpful Options
- Explore additional options like checking your average score, resetting saved results, and adjusting the total number of questions in the quiz.

### Language-Friendly
- My app speaks your language! It adapts to your device's locale, making it accessible to a diverse global audience.

### Fragment Magic
- Behind the scenes, I have followed the best practices in Android development, using fragments to enhance the app's structure and maintainability.
